# my-first-repo
This is my first GitHub repository
Hello! I'm Kirushanthan.
I am currently pursuing my degree in Health Information and Communication Technology (HICT) at the Gampaha Wickramarachchi University of Indigenous Medicine.
I am highly interested in pursuing IT-related jobs where I can apply my knowledge of both technology and the healthcare domain. I am using this repository to practice using Git/GitHub and organize my projects as I prepare for a career in the technology sector.
